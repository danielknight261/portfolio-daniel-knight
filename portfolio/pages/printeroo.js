          <p>Project</p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            This project was born out of a chance opportunity. I was looking for
            something to do one weekend and came across an ad for Shopify
            offering a 3-month subscription for just Â£1 per month. I was
            intrigued and decided to give it a try.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            The project was built using a combination of different technologies,
            including the Shopify add-on Layout hub, which allows for building a
            website with simple drag-and-drop elements. This was a departure
            from my usual method of building projects using Javascript, CSS, and
            HTML in Visual Code, but it was a great opportunity to learn and
            experiment with new tools.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            What made the project particularly interesting was that everything
            in LayoutHub is written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I had
            full access to customise all elements throughout the process. This
            allowed me to infuse my own unique style and creativity into the
            website.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Additionally, I used the Shopify add-on Gelato, which enabled me to
            integrate a feature that allows customers to add their own images to
            a canvas, mug, or tote bag and see it rendered on screen. This added
            an interactive element to the website that was both fun and engaging
            for users.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            The site is still a work in progress, but it was a lot of fun to
            build. The project has been added to my portfolio, along with a demo
            link, so that others can see the end result and how it was built. It
            was a great learning experience and I look forward to experimenting
            with more e-commerce platforms and technologies in the future.
